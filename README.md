# TTS DNS configuration

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA-TTS/dns.svg?branch=main&style-svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA-TTS/dns)

This repository holds the source code for configuring DNS for domains managed by GSA TTS.

## Making changes

Assuming you're TTS staff, it's recommended that you **make the change in a branch on this repository itself, rather than on a fork**, because the credentials aren't shared with forks. (The `main` branch is [protected](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) to limit write access only to certain staff, and to ensure history doesn't get overwritten, etc.) For major changes, it is recommended to keep the TTL value low just before and during the change period in order to make it easier to verify the changes went through as expected.

1. Is the domain pointing to the right nameservers? In other words, is there a file for the domain under [`terraform/`](terraform) already?
   - **Yes:** Continue to next step.
   - **No:**
     1. Add a file for the domain (or subdomain, if the second-level domain isn't being added), to create the [public hosted zone](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html).
        - [`analytics.usa.gov`](terraform/analytics.usa.gov.tf) is a good example to copy from.
        - You'll be using Terraform's [`aws_route53_zone`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/route53_zone.html).
        - If it's an existing domain, you'll want to make sure all existing records are copied over, so that they don't break when the cutover happens. You can ask the existing DNS managers for a list of records or a [zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file) for the domain and all subdomains.
     1. After the pull request is merged, to get the name servers for your domain check the output for your build in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA-TTS/dns). If you need further assistance, check with [#admins-dns](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C4L58EQ5T).
     1. Change the nameservers for the domain to point to AWS.
        - For second-level domains, this will be done by the "domain manager" in [dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov/). [More information about .gov domain management.](https://home.dotgov.gov/management/)
1. Add the relevant additional [record sets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.html). In Terraform, these are known as [`aws_route53_record`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_record.html)s.

It's worth noting that if you are pointing to a CloudFront distro, you should use Route 53's own `alias` and not a CNAME record. In fact, CNAMEing a top-level domain (or the top level of a delegated subdomain) is not allowed in DNS. See the various examples in the repo, such as [this one](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/dns/blob/deploy/terraform/usa.gov.tf#L8-L17).

On merge, changes are deployed to an AWS account hosting the Route53 records automatically by a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA-TTS/dns) job.

### Redirects

[Redirects are managed here](https://github.com/cloud-gov/pages-redirects) 

If the redirecting domain is assigned to any CloudFront distribution in any AWS account, it will need to be unassociated before the module above can be successfully deployed.

## Stubbing files

We keep a Terraform file for every TTS domain, even if it's just a comment referencing DNS managed elsewhere.
